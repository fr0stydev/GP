# Graduation Project

Graduation Project for Keio University Environment and Information Studies

## Objective

Create a new penetration testing tool
Ideally, this tool will scan for webapp's application and if a version is successfully detected it will perform a scan to check for existing exploits as well as give information on the exploit.


## Goals

1. Rank the exploits found
2. Currently not detecting CMS (?)
3. Make sure other application is not searched (EX. Stripe != SilverStripe)
4. Make a table listing the summary of exploit, CVSS, URL to exploit

# Graduation Project

Graduation Project for Keio University Environment and Information Studies

## Objective

Create a new penetration testing tool.  

Ideally, this tool will scan for webapp's application and if a version is successfully detected it will perform a scan to check for existing exploits as well as give information on the exploit.

## Requirements

1. Nodejs <14.0.0
2. Python3

## How to Use

1. run the app.js file in wapp-local
2. python3 main.py 

## Ideas

1. Currently if version not detected then skips it. Maybe add a flag to not skip
2. PDF Report??
3. Hostlist option to include file with defined URLs. Currently added but needs to combine all exploits found on URL into one file, currently  replaces the file

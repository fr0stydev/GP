# Graduation Project

Graduation Project for Keio University Environment and Information Studies

## Objective

Create a new penetration testing tool.  

Ideally, this tool will scan for webapp's application and if a version is successfully detected it will perform a scan to check for existing exploits as well as give information on the exploit.


## Ideas

1. Currently if version not detected then skips it. Maybe add a flag to not skip
2. PDF Report??
